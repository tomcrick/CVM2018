Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please find enclosed our manuscript, ``Resolving Display Shape Dependence Issues on Tabletops'' by McNaughton, Crick and Smith, which we would like to submit for publication as an original article in Elsevier's Displays.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper that considers the design of software for use on a range of differently shaped tabletop displays, proposing a novel but extensible technique that can be used to minimise the influence of the issues of using different display shapes. Furthermore, observations on this technique explore how it can be used to adapt the layout of tabletop software to different display shapes, identifying a range of potential applications and emerging research priorities. We believe this technique and our wider findings would appeal to the readership of Displays.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have contributed to and approved thefinal manuscript and fully support its submission to Displays.

Please address all correspondence to me at j.a.mcnaughton@durham.ac.uk; we look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Yours faithfully,
